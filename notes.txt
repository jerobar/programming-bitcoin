FINITE FIELDS

A finite field is a set of numbers and two operations that satisfy the following:

1 - Closed. If a and b are in the set, then a + b and a * b are in the set.
2 - Additive Identity. 0 exists and has the property a + 0 = a.
3 - Mulitiplicative Identity. 1 exists and has the property a * 1 = a.
4 - Additive Inverse. If a is in the set, -a is in the set such that a + (-a) = 0.
5 - Mulitiplicative Inverse. If a is in the set and =/= 0, a^-1 is in the set such that a * a^-1 = 1.

These conditions may be met by defining operations such as addition and subtraction in a specific way.

The order of the set, p, is how big the set is. Fields must have an order that is a power of a prime.

The elements of the set may be defined Fp = {0, 1, 2, ... p - 1}.

Addition:
a +f b = (a + b) % p, where a, b are elements of Fp.

Additive Inverse:
-fa = (-a) % p

Subtraction:
a -f b = (a - b) % p

Multipication:
a *f b = (a * b) % p

Division:
b^-1 = b^(p - 2)


MODULO ARITHMETIC

The modulo operation % is the remainder after division of one number by another, e.g. 7  % 3 = 1. 
Modulo may also be performed on negative numbers, e.g. -13 % 12 = 11 (-13 = (12 * -2) + 11).

The modulo operator has a useful property that large numbers can be brought down into a small range.

Most operations in finite fields use the modulo operator in some capacity.


Fermat's Little Theorem

For all prime p and n > 0: n^(p - 1) % p = 1


ELLIPTIC CURVES

Elliptic curves have the form: 

y^2 = x^3 + ax + b

It is similar to a cubic curve but the y^2 term has the effect of making the graph symmetric 
about the x-axis.

The elliptic curve used in bitcoin is called secp256k1 and it uses the equation:

y^2 = x^3 + 7


Point Additon:

An operation performed on two points along an elliptic curve resulting in a third point.

For every elliptic curve, a line will intersect it at either one point or three, except in a few 
special cases (when the line is vertical or when the line is tangent to the curve). When two points 
are added, the result is the third point along the line reflected over the x-axis. Point addition 
is difficult to predict, it is nonlinear. 


ELLIPTIC CURVE CRYPTOGRAPHY

Elliptic curves can also be drawn over finite fields.

We can verify the point (17, 64) is on the curve y^2 = x^3 + 7 over F103:

y^2 = 64^2 % 103 = 79
x^3 + 7 = (17^3 + 7) % 103 = 79

The same point addition equations with addition, subtraction, multipication, division, and 
exponentiation defined for finite fields still apply.


Scalar Multiplication:

(170, 142) + (170, 142) = 2 o (170, 142)

Scalar multiplication is very difficult to predict without actually calculating. Performing scalar 
multipication is straightforward, but doing the opposite, point division, is not. This is known as the 
discrete log problem, and is the basis of elliptic curve crypography. Scalar multiplication over elliptic 
curves is an asymmetric problem. 

At some multiple, we reach the point at infinity:

{ G, 2G, 3G, ... , 4G, nG } where nG = 0

This set is called a finite cyclic group. Groups behave predictably under addition: 2G + 3G = 5G. 

An elliptic curve for public key cryptography is specified by:

- The a and b of the curve
- The order, prime
- The coordinates of the generator point G
- We specify the order of the group generated by G, n
